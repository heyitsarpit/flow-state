# Progress: Flow State v3 production

Roadmap: roadmap.md
State: stopped: the roadmap is not yet approved
Phase: none started. Iteration: 0. Revision: see `git log` on `flow-rewrite`
Budget used: none of the proposed total
Next action: on approval, start phase 1 (the plan merge, approved on 2026-11-04), with
`FOR-ARPIT.md` Q1-Q8 in the first question round.
Waiting on the user:
- approval of roadmap.md and answers to R1-R7;
- `FOR-ARPIT.md` Q1-Q8 and the 20 calls;
- the services choice: no `services` list, types only (recommended), or a required list on every
  operation;
- which example apps to build (phase 6). Candidates are below.

## Phases

- [ ] 1 Plan merge: not started
- [ ] 2 Pre-work prototype (entities, streams, migration; round 13's H1 and H2): not started
- [ ] 3 Conformance rewrite: not started
- [ ] 4 Core: not started
- [ ] 5 Features: not started
- [ ] 6 Example apps: not started
- [ ] 7 Documentation: not started
- [ ] 8 Hardening and budgets: not started
- [ ] 9 Release: not started

## Failure ledger

| Part or gate | Root-cause class, one sentence | Failures | Last revision | State |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| (none yet) | | | | |

Carried from the prototype, as prior art: the ending oracle failed its gate eight times, one step
further each time (round 10, stages C-J), until convergence in stages K and L.

## Agents running

| Agent | Started | Last checkpoint | Last review |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| (none) | | | |

## Calls for the user's read

Calls made under delegation before this roadmap are listed in
`packages/flow-state-v3/prototypes/FOR-ARPIT.md` section 2. New calls go here, one line each: the
call, its reason, its evidence, and how reversible it is.

## Example app candidates (proposed, for the user's pick)

The user likes these (2026-11-04); the final pick is still the user's. Each is a Next.js demo with a
live inspector panel beside the app, showing `flow trace` and `flow graph` as it runs, so the demo
shows its own guarantees. The user also set two requirements:
- Each app explains what it is demoing, with a write-up beside it, and tooltips that open a popup
  to show a feature off at the moment it happens.
- One demo shows the Story presentation feature: Stories played back as a presentation.

| App | What it demos |
| --- | --- |
| **Pull the plug**, a shop where you can kill the tab, go offline or reload mid-payment, and still never get charged twice | Write-ahead, unknown outcomes, business keys, 3-D Secure as a fragment |
| **Live auction**, with bids streaming in, optimistic bids, outbid races, countdowns and reconnects | Streams, entities, `latest`/`reject` concurrency, timers |
| **Agent console**, a small Codex-like chat: streamed output, tool calls approved step by step, runs resumable across a reload | Streams, subroutines, persistence, cancel and retry; a step toward the Electron stretch goal |
| **Mission control**, thousands of live objects (satellites or flights) on a map, with doubt marks when the feed drops and repairs when it returns | Entities at scale, listen frames, doubt and repair, performance |
| **Smart home**, a panel of simulated devices where a command may or may not have happened ("did the light turn on?") | Unknown outcomes, retries, device streams, multi-tab ownership |
| **Escape room**, a puzzle game whose deep state machine doubles as its own walkthrough, with Stories as replays | Fragments, `flow graph`, Stories, record migration between game versions |

## Log

One line per iteration. Results live in the records; link them.
- 2026-11-04 setup `5d92e2d3`: lint-bomb vendored and wired. The throwaway file caught 6 of its 6
  seeded violations, the frozen and prototype paths were not linted, and the rule tests passed.
  `nub run verify` fails at `build:library` (the frozen package), as it did at `d4d54074`.
  Results: `tools/lint-bomb/FLOW-STATE.md`.
- 2026-11-04 first roadmap draft `0ecda35d`. The user rejected its new prototype rounds and gave
  the shape.
- 2026-11-04 `tools/oxlint/anti-slop/` deleted (`6bd32fbb`).
- 2026-11-04 lint rules added and evaluated (`6f6c1309` to `6593b072`); lint-bomb at `183d43b`.
- 2026-11-04 roadmap rebuilt from the updated roadmap skill. A cold read found 4 contradictions
  and 10 ambiguities. All are fixed:
  - M5 moved to phase 2, and the H1/H2 fixes are named in the prototyping constraint;
  - phase 2's plan edits went to R6;
  - examples come before docs;
  - budgets got numbers (R7), and the reserve got a default;
  - the convergence stop and the "no new decision" stop were aligned, also in the skill;
  - paths are written in full, and a glossary added;
  - a real phone is the user's step.
  A second cold read has not been run.
